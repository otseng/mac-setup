## httpd

DocumentRoot is /usr/local/var/www.

The default ports have been set in /usr/local/etc/httpd/httpd.conf to 8080 and in
/usr/local/etc/httpd/extra/httpd-ssl.conf to 8443 so that httpd can run without sudo.

To have launchd start httpd now and restart at login:
  brew services start httpd
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  apachectl start

## PHP

    </FilesMatch>

Finally, check DirectoryIndex includes index.php
    DirectoryIndex index.php index.html
